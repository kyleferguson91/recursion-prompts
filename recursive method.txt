must have:
- base case in which the function can return the result immediately
- recursive case: in which the function must call itself to break the problem down to a simpler level


//Break the problem I am trying to solve down into a problem that is one step simpler
   // Assume that my function will work to solve the simpler problem â€” really believe it beyond any doubt
	ask myself: since i know i can solve the simpler problem, how would i solve the more complex one
