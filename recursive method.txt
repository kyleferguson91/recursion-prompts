One common mistake that I see people make when trying to develop a recursive algorithm to solve a problem 
is that they try to think about how to break the problem down all the way to the base case. 


I would like to emphasize that in order to develop the function above, 
I did not think about how I could break the problem down all the way to the base case. 
That is the function’s job, not yours.
